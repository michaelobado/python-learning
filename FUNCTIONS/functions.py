# 1. Functions introduce two new keywords: def and return
# Both of these keywords are colored orange in IDLE. The def keyword names the function
# (shown in blue), and details any arguments the function may have. The use of the return
# keyword is optional, and is used to pass back a value to the code that invoked the function.

# 2. Functions can accept argument data
# A function can accept argument data (i.e., input to the function). You can specify a list of
# arguments between the parentheses on the def line, following the functionâ€™s name.

# 3. Functions contain code and (usually) documentation
# Code is indented one level beneath the def line, and should include comments where it
# makes sense. We demonstrate two ways to add comments to code: using a triple-quoted
# string (shown in green in the template and known as a docstring), and using a single-line
# comment, which is prefixed by the # symbol
